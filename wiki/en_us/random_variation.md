## Random variation (1.16.5-2.x.x; 1.18.1-3.x.x; Future 1.18.2-4.x.x releases (not yet)

There are many structures that can also have variant materials. E.g. the Watchtower is built from spruce, but a dark oak watchtower could be naturally generated as a new, fresh alternative. Shrines' Random variation feature exchanges the materials of its builds on every placement. You can see a Balloon in white, in red, purple, green etc.
Since 3.x.x you're also able to fully configure random variation through datapacks.

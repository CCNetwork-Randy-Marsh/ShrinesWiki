## Structure Novels

Every structure in this mod is carefully constructed to be both functional and immersive. Each one has its own personality and place in the Minecraft world. You can use Shrines' builds to create your own story, but there are also stories you can uncover in game with this mod. Follow Jon and his family on their adventures as you explore new Shrines structures or traverse the world to find all the old, scrapped pages of his diary.

## How to Update Shrines structures mod to version 3.x.x from 1.8.1

> This only works since version 3.0.0-Beta12. Before that version, you needed to [update to 2.x.x](UpdateTo2.0.0From1.8.1.md) before

On most recent version, the update shouldn't cause issues in most cases. You don't even need to import legacy 
custom structures, as it was necessary when updating to 2.x.x. The main problem remains the structure
generation system change to jigsaw. Read more about that [here](UpdateTo2.0.0From1.8.1.md)

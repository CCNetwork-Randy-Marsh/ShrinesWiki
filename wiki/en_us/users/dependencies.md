### Dependencies

> Only Shrines versions for 1.18.1 require a dependency at all

**What is a dependency mod?**

A dependency mod is a mod just like every other mod too. The installation procedure is the same, the update procedure is the same,
the download procedure is the same, you don't even need to do anything special.

**Why is a dependency required?**

Dependencies usually provide code features and functions that other mods can use. For example one dependency (aka library) mod
could make it easier for other mods to add new items. These features only exist if you install the library mod, just like
structures of a structure mod only appear if you install the structure mod.

**What does that mean for Shrines?**

In one certain version of Shrines (all versions for Minecraft 1.18.1, **not** above **not** below), there was a feature, that
Shrines required to work, but Forge didn't offer it. Therefore, it requires the dynamicregistries mod now. Without that mod,
Shrines wouldn't be able to offer features like random variation and structure novels in the way it does now.

**What do I need to do?**

If you use Shrines for 1.18.1, you need to install a second mod alongside it (You can see the Minecraft version in the filename).
You can download dynamicregistries from curseforge, modrinth and gitbuh, just like shrines (download links at the bottom of thsi page).
If you miss installing this second mod, Shrines will crash on start-up due to a Forge issue.
